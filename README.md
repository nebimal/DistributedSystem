## Overview
This project implements a **distributed e-commerce system** using **two different system architectures** to compare performance, scalability, and design trade-offs:

1. **RESTful Server–Client Architecture (C++ Crow Framework)**  
   - Focuses on simplicity and HTTP-based interaction.  
   - Implements REST APIs, Nginx load balancing, PostgreSQL for data persistence, and Redis caching.

2. **Microservice gRPC Architecture (Python)**  
   - Focuses on modularity and efficient inter-service communication via gRPC.  
   - Each service (User, Product, Order, Payment, Shipping) runs in an isolated container.

Both architectures simulate core e-commerce functionality like browsing products, registering users, placing orders, and processing payments and shipping, but differ in **communication model**, **deployment structure**, and **scalability characteristics**.

## How to Run
To execute either implementation:

1. Navigate to the corresponding project folder:  
   - `cd REST-Server-Client`  
   - `cd MicroService-gRPC`  

2. Open the respective `README.md` file inside that folder.  
   Each README provides detailed steps to **build, run, and test** the system.
